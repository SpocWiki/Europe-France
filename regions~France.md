> France is divided into eighteen administrative regions 
> (French: régions, singular région [ʁeʒjɔ̃]), 
> of which thirteen are located in metropolitan France (in Europe), 
> while the other five are overseas regions 
> (not to be confused with the overseas collectivities, 
> which have a semi-autonomous status).
>
> All of the thirteen metropolitan administrative regions (including Corsica as of 2019) 
> are further subdivided into two to thirteen administrative departments, 
> with the prefect of each region's administrative centre's department 
> also acting as the regional prefect. 
> The overseas regions administratively consist of only one department each 
> and hence also have the status of overseas departments.
>
> Most administrative regions also have the status of regional territorial collectivities, 
> which comes with a local government, 
> with departmental and communal collectivities below the regions level. 
> The exceptions are [[regions~France/Corse|Corse]], [[../../../America~South/Guianas/French_Guiana|French Guiana]], [[../../../Africa/Africa~East/Mayotte|Mayotte]] and [[../../../America~Caribbean/Martinique|Martinique]], 
> where region and department functions are managed by single local governments 
> having consolidated jurisdiction and which are known as single territorial collectivities.
