This Repository/Folder/Wiki/Vault contains freely usable Text and Data 
covering the European country of [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France). 

This Repository is intended to be shared as a common basis, 
by including it as a Sub-Repository in local File-Systems, 
specifically as part of the [\_Standards](https://github.com/SpocWiki/_Standards) Repository.

> Caution: this is a very deep folder Structure with up to 170 Characters! 
> Make sure to check it out into a shallow Location on Windows! 
> 
> If you see an opportunity to reduce this Depth, create an Issue and discuss first, 
> because Changes may break Links or at least require every User

> 
> Constraints to consider when refactoring: 
> - Every Folder Name should be unique, also the grouping-Folders, so you can link to it without specifying the relative Path 
> - all Link-Paths should be relative. Wiki-Links are possible, but only when the Target-Folders or Files have unique Names. 
> - Between each Level and its Sub-Levels there should be a grouping Folder, to allow adding other Lists. 
>   - e.g. a City's boroughs should NOT be directly in the City Folder, but in a Sub-Folder named `City~boroughs`
