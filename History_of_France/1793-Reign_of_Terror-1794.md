## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Reign of Terror (French: La Terreur, lit. 'The Terror') 
> was a period of the French Revolution when, following the creation of the First Republic, 
> a series of massacres and numerous public executions took place 
> in response to the Federalist revolts, revolutionary fervour, anticlerical sentiment, 
> and accusations of treason by the Committee of Public Safety. 
> While terror was never formally instituted as a legal policy by the Convention, 
> it was more often employed as a concept.
>
> Historians disagree when exactly the "Terror" began. Some consider it to have begun in 1793, often giving the date as 5 September or 10 March, when the Revolutionary Tribunal came into existence. Others cite the earlier September Massacres in 1792, or even July 1789 when the first killing of the revolution occurred. Will Durant stated that "strictly, it should be dated from the Law of Suspects, September 17, 1793, to the execution of Maximilien Robespierre, July 28, 1794."
>
> The Terror concluded with the fall of Robespierre and his alleged allies in July 1794, in what is known as the Thermidorian Reaction. By then, 16,594 official death sentences had been dispensed throughout France since June 1793, of which 2,639 were in Paris alone. An additional 10,000 people had been executed without trial or died in prison.
