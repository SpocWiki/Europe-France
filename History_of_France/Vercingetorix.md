> **Vercingetorix** (Latin: [wɛrkɪŋˈɡɛtɔriːks]; Ancient Greek: Οὐερκιγγετόριξ 
> [u.erkiŋɡeˈtoriks]; c. 80 – 46 BC) was a Gallic king and chieftain of the Arverni tribe 
> who united the Gauls in a failed revolt against Roman forces 
> during the last phase of Julius Caesar's Gallic Wars. 
> 
> After surrendering to Caesar and spending almost six years in prison, 
> he was executed in Rome.
>
> Vercingetorix was the son of Celtillus the Arvernian, leader of the Gallic tribes. 
> Vercingetorix came to power after his formal designation as chieftain of the Arverni 
> at the oppidum Gergovia in 52 BC. 
> 
> He immediately established an alliance with other Gallic tribes, 
> took command, combined all forces, 
> and led them in the Celts' most significant revolt against Roman power. 
> 
> He won the Battle of Gergovia against Julius Caesar 
> in which several thousand Romans and their allies were killed, 
> and the Roman legions withdrew.
>
> Caesar had been able to exploit Gaulish internal divisions 
> to easily subjugate the country, 
> since Vercingetorix's attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late. 
> 
> At the Battle of Alesia in 52 BC the Romans besieged and defeated his forces. 
> 
> To spare as many of his men as possible, he gave himself to the Romans. 
> He was held prisoner for five years. 
> In 46 BC as part of Caesar's triumph, he was paraded through the streets of Rome 
> and then executed by garrote. 
> 
> Vercingetorix is primarily known through Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico 
> (Commentaries on the Gallic War). 
> 
> He is considered a folk hero in France, and especially in Auvergne, his native region.
