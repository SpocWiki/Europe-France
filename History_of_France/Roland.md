> **Roland** (French pronunciation: [ʁɔ.lɑ̃]; Old Frankish: Hrōþiland; 
> Medieval Latin: Hruodlandus or Rotholandus; Italian: Orlando or Rolando; 
> died 15 August 778) was a Frankish military leader under Charlemagne 
> who became an epic hero and one of the principal figures 
> in the literary cycle known as the Matter of France. 
> 
> The historical Roland was military governor of the Breton March, 
> responsible for defending Francia's frontier against the Bretons. 
> His only historical attestation is in Einhard's Vita Karoli Magni, 
> which notes he was part of the Frankish rearguard 
> killed in retribution by the Basques in Iberia at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass.
>
> The story of Roland's death at Roncevaux Pass 
> was embellished in later medieval and Renaissance literature. 
> The first and most famous of these epic treatments 
> was the Old French Chanson de Roland of the 11th century.
>
> Two masterpieces of Italian Renaissance poetry, the Orlando Innamorato 
> and Orlando Furioso (by Matteo Maria Boiardo and Ludovico Ariosto, respectively), 
> are even further detached from history than the earlier Chansons, 
> similarly to the later Morgante by Luigi Pulci. 
> 
> Roland is poetically associated with his sword Durendal, his horse Veillantif, 
> and his oliphant horn.
>
> In the late 17th century, French Baroque composer Jean-Baptiste Lully 
> wrote an opera titled Roland, based on the story of the title character.
