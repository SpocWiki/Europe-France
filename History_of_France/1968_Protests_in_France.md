> May 68 (French: Mai 68) was a period of widespread protests, strikes, 
> and civil unrest in France that began in May 1968 
> and became one of the most significant social uprisings in modern European history. 
> 
> Sparked by student demonstrations against university conditions 
> and government repression, 
> the movement quickly escalated into a nationwide general strike 
> involving millions of workers, bringing the country to the brink of revolution. 
> The events have profoundly shaped French politics, labor relations, 
> and cultural life, leaving a lasting legacy of radical thought and activism.
>
> After World War II, France underwent rapid modernization, economic growth, 
> and urbanization, leading to increased social tensions. 
> (The period from 1945 to 1975 is known as the Trente Glorieuses, 
> the "Thirty Glorious Years", but it was also a time of exacerbated inequalities 
> and alienation, particularly among students and young workers.) 
> 
> By the late 1960s, France's university system was struggling 
> to accommodate a growing student population, 
> and the rigid structure of academia frustrated students 
> amid a broader discontent with conservative social norms. 
> 
> Inspired by countercultural, anti-imperialist, Marxist, and anarchist ideologies, 
> students increasingly viewed themselves 
> as part of a revolutionary struggle against capitalism and authoritarianism. 
> At the same time, the French working class was dissatisfied with stagnant wages 
> and poor working conditions, despite growth. 
> 
> The political order, dominated by President Charles de Gaulle's Fifth Republic, 
> was seen by many as outdated and repressive. 
>
> The movement began with student demonstrations 
> in late March at Paris Nanterre University. 
> 
> After the police intervened to suppress ongoing activism, 
> Nanterre was shut down on 2 May, and protests moved to the Sorbonne in central Paris. 
> 
> On 6 May, police violently dispersed a student gathering at the Sorbonne, 
> leading to clashes with protesters and mass arrests. As the confrontations escalated, students erected barricades, and the night of 10 May saw intense street battles between protesters and police. Public outrage fueled further mobilization, and by 13 May, the protests had evolved into a general strike. About 10 million workers, or two-thirds of the labor force, walked off the job in the largest general strike in French history, shutting down factories, transportation, and public services. Radical leftist groups gained influence, and calls for revolution grew louder. De Gaulle's government struggled to regain control, and on 29 May he briefly left to a French military base in West Germany. He returned on the next day, dissolved the National Assembly, and called for new elections. By this point, the movement had started to lose momentum. The government, business leaders, and union representatives had negotiated the Grenelle agreements on 27 May, securing wage increases and concessions. As de Gaulle reasserted authority, the revolutionary moment faded. In the elections on 23 June, his party won a resounding victory, signaling the collapse of the immediate movement.

> Though it failed to bring about a revolution, May 68 had profound long-term consequences. The events weakened de Gaulle's authority, and he resigned the following year. The movement led to increased state investment in education and social policies, though radical leftist politics declined in electoral influence. The strikes forced major concessions in labor rights, including wage increases, better working conditions, and expanded social protections. The May 68 movement also contributed to the growth of feminist, environmentalist, and LGBTQ activism, and inspired radical thought in philosophy, media, and academia, influencing figures like Michel Foucault and Jean Baudrillard. In France, the movement's slogans and imagery remain touchstones of political and social discourse.
