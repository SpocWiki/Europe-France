> The Paris Commune (French: Commune de Paris, pronounced [kɔ.myn də pa.ʁi]) 
> was a French revolutionary government that seized power in Paris on 18 March 1871 
> and controlled parts of the city until 28 May 1871. 
> 
> During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, 
> the French National Guard had defended Paris, 
> and working class radicalism grew among its soldiers. 
> 
> Following the establishment of the French Third Republic in September 1870 
> (under French chief-executive Adolphe Thiers from February 1871) 
> and the complete defeat of the French Army by the Germans by March 1871, 
> soldiers of the National Guard seized control of the city on 18 March. 
> 
> The Communards killed two French Army generals 
> and refused to accept the authority of the Third Republic; 
> instead, the radicals set about establishing their own independent government.
>
> The Commune governed Paris for two months, 
> promoting policies that tended toward a progressive,  anti-religious system, 
> which was an eclectic mix of many 19th-century schools of thought. 
> 
> These policies included the separation of church and state, self-policing, 
> the remission of rent, the abolition of child labor, 
> and the right of employees to take over an enterprise deserted by its owner. 
> 
> The Commune closed all Catholic churches and schools in Paris. 
> Feminist, communist, old-style social democracy (a mix of reformism and revolutionism), and anarchist/Proudhonist currents, among other socialist types, 
> played important roles in the Commune.
>
> The various Communards had little more than two months 
> to achieve their respective goals before the national French Army 
> suppressed the Commune during the semaine sanglante ("bloody week") 
> beginning on 21 May 1871. 
> 
> The national forces still loyal to the Third Republic government 
> either killed in battle or executed an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 Communards, 
> though one unconfirmed estimate from 1876 put the toll as high as 20,000. 
> 
> In its final days, the Commune executed the Archbishop of Paris, Georges Darboy, 
> and about one hundred hostages, mostly  gendarmes and priests.
>
> National army forces took 43,522 Communards as prisoners, including 1,054 women. 
> More than half of the prisoners had not fought, and were released immediately.  
> The Third Republic tried around 15,000 in court, 13,500 of whom were found guilty, 
> 95 were sentenced to death, 251 to forced labor, and 1,169 to deportation 
> (mostly to  New Caledonia). 
> 
> Many other Commune supporters, including several of the leaders, fled abroad, 
> mostly to England, Belgium or Switzerland. 
> All the surviving prisoners and exiles received pardons in 1880 and could return home, 
> where some resumed political careers.
>
> Debates over the policies and result of the Commune had significant influence 
> on the ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, 
> who described the régime in Paris as the first example of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
> Engels wrote: "Of late, the Social-Democratic philistine has once more been filled 
> with wholesome terror at the words: Dictatorship of the Proletariat. 
> Well and good, gentlemen, do you want to know what this dictatorship looks like? 
> Look at the Paris Commune. That was the Dictatorship of the Proletariat."
