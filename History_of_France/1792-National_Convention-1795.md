> The National Convention (French: Convention nationale, [kɔ̃vɑ̃sjɔ̃ nɑsjɔnal]) 
> was the constituent assembly of the Kingdom of France for one day 
> and of the French First Republic for its first three years during the French Revolution, 
> following the two-year National Constituent Assembly 
> and the one-year Legislative Assembly. 
> 
> The National Convention was created after the insurrection of 10 August 1792. 
> It was the first French government organized as a republic, 
> abandoning the monarchy altogether. 
> 
> The Convention sat as a single-chamber assembly from 20 September 1792 
> to 26 October 1795 (4 Brumaire IV under the Convention's adopted calendar).
>
> The Convention came about 
> when the Legislative Assembly decreed the provisional suspension of King Louis XVI 
> and the convocation of a National Convention 
> to draw up a new constitution with no monarchy. 
> 
> The other major innovation was to decree 
> that deputies to that Convention should be elected 
> by all Frenchmen 21 years old or more, domiciled for a year 
> and living by the product of their labor. 
> 
> The National Convention was, therefore, 
> the first French assembly elected by a suffrage without distinctions of class.
>
> Although the Convention lasted until 1795, 
> power was effectively delegated by the Convention 
> and concentrated in the small Committee of Public Safety from April 1793. 
> 
> The eight months from the fall of 1793 to the spring of 1794, 
> when Maximilien Robespierre and his allies dominated the Committee of Public Safety, 
> represent the most radical and bloodiest phase of the French Revolution, 
> known as the Reign of Terror. 
> 
> After the fall of Robespierre, the Convention lasted for another year 
> until a new constitution was written, ushering in the French Directory.
