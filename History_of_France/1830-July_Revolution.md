> The July Revolution (French: révolution de Juillet), also known as the French Revolution of 1830, 
> Second French Revolution, or Trois Glorieuses ("Three Glorious [Days]"), 
> was a second French Revolution after the first of 1789–99. 
> 
> It led to the overthrow of King Charles X, the French Bourbon monarch, 
> and the ascent of his cousin Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans. 
>
> The 1830 Revolution marked a shift from that point on 
> as the constitutional monarchy was restored with the July Monarchy; 
> the transition of power from the House of Bourbon to its cadet branch, the House of Orléans; 
> and the replacement of the principle of hereditary right by that of popular sovereignty. 
> 
> Supporters of the Bourbons would be called Legitimists, 
> and supporters of Louis Philippe were known as Orléanists. 
> 
> In addition, there continued to be Bonapartists supporting the return of Napoleon's heirs. 
> After 18 precarious years on the throne, 
> Louis-Philippe was overthrown in the French Revolution of 1848.
