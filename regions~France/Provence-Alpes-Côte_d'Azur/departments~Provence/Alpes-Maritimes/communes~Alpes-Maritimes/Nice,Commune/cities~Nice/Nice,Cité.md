## #has_/text_of_/abstract  

> **Nice** ( NEESS; French pronunciation: [nis] ) is a city in 
> and the prefecture of the [[../Alpes-Maritimes|Alpes-Maritimes]] department in France. 
> The Nice agglomeration extends far beyond the administrative city limits, 
> with a population of nearly one million on an area of 744 km2 (287 sq mi). 
> Located on the French Riviera, 
> the southeastern coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, 
> at the foot of the French Alps, 
> Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast 
> and second-largest city in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region after Marseille. 
> Nice is approximately 13 kilometres (8 mi) from the principality of Monaco 
> and 30 kilometres (19 mi) from the French–Italian border. 
> Nice's airport serves as a gateway to the region.
>
> The city is nicknamed Nice la Belle (Nissa La Bella in Niçard), 
> meaning 'Nice the Beautiful', 
> which is also the title of the unofficial anthem of Nice, 
> written by Menica Rondelly in 1912. 
> 
> The area of today's Nice contains Terra Amata, an archaeological site 
> which displays evidence of a very early use of fire 380,000 years ago. 
> Around 350 BC, Greeks of Marseille founded a permanent settlement 
> and called it Nikaia, after Nike, the goddess of victory. 
> Through the ages, the town has changed hands many times. 
> Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. 
> From 1388, it was a dominion of Savoy, 
> then became part of the French First Republic between 1792 and 1815, 
> when it was returned to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, 
> the legal predecessor of the Kingdom of Italy, 
> until its annexation by France in 1860.
>
> The natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate 
> came to the attention of the English upper classes 
> in the second half of the 18th century, 
> when an increasing number of aristocratic families 
> began spending their winters there. 
> 
> In 1931, following its refurbishment, 
> the city's main seaside promenade, the Promenade des Anglais 
> ("Walkway of the English"), was inaugurated by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught; 
> it owes its name to visitors to the resort. 
> These included Queen Victoria along with her son Edward VII 
> who spent winters there, as well as Henry Cavendish, 
> born in Nice, who discovered hydrogen.
>
> The clear air and soft light have particularly appealed to notable painters, 
> such as Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Niki de Saint Phalle, and Arman. 
> Their work is commemorated in many of the city's museums, 
> including Musée Marc Chagall, Musée Matisse and Musée des Beaux-Arts. 
> 
> International writers have also been attracted and inspired by the city. 
> Frank Harris wrote several books including his autobiography My Life and Loves in Nice. 
> Friedrich Nietzsche spent six consecutive winters in Nice, 
> and wrote Thus Spoke Zarathustra there. 
> Additionally, Russian writer Anton Chekhov completed his play Three Sisters while living in Nice.
>
> Nice's appeal extended to the Russian upper classes. 
> Prince Nicholas Alexandrovich, heir apparent to Imperial Russia, 
> died in Nice and was a patron of the Russian Orthodox Cemetery, Nice 
> where Princess Catherine Dolgorukova, 
> morganatic wife of the Tsar Alexander II of Russia, is buried. 
> Also buried there are General Dmitry Shcherbachev and General Nikolai Yudenich, 
> leaders of the anti-Communist White Movement.
>
> Those interred at the Cimetière du Château include 
> - celebrated jeweler Alfred Van Cleef, 
> - Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, founder of the Mercedes car company, 
> - film director Louis Feuillade, 
> - poet Agathe-Sophie Sasserno,

> - The Phantom of the Opera author Gaston Leroux, 
> - French prime minister Léon Gambetta, and the 
> - first president of the International Court of Justice José Gustavo Guerrero.
>
> Because of its historical importance as a winter resort town 
> for the European aristocracy and the resulting mix of cultures found in the city, 
> UNESCO proclaimed Nice a World Heritage Site in 2021. 
> 
> The city has the second largest hotel capacity in the country, 
> and it is the second most visited metropolis in Metropolitan France, 
> receiving four million tourists every year. 
> It also has the third busiest airport in France, after the two main Parisian ones. 
> It is the historical capital city of the County of Nice 
> (French: Comté de Nice, Niçard: Countèa de Nissa).
